In this we are using hbs rendering.(Server side rendering)
where we only need toh have backend Javascript code.
Any request sent in serviced by sending a new html page.
Here view engine hbs in used.

NOTE: Even if the Javascript is disabled by the client then also our website will work fine as it is independent of using client(browser) side JS...
